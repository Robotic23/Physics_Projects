Experiment: To study the motion of a freely falling body and find acceleration due to gravity
Objective:
To verify the equations of motion under gravity and determine the relationship between height, time, and velocity for a freely falling body.

Apparatus / Tools:
1. Python program (Free Fall Simulation)
2. Computer with Python and Matplotlib installed
(In a real lab: metallic ball, electromagnet release, timer, meter scale, sand tray)

Formulae Used
1. h = 1/2*gt^2  2. v = gt (u is omitted as it is zero)
where,
h = height (m),
g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²),
t = time of fall (s),
v = final velocity (m/s)

Procedure:
1. Enter the number of observations in the Python program.
2. Input different heights of fall (in meters).
The program calculates time of fall using
t = sqrt(2h/g)
It then computes final velocity using v=gt.
The results are displayed in a table and graphs of Height vs Time and Velocity vs Time are plotted.

Observations
Obs	Height (m)	 Time (s)	Final Velocity (m/s)
1	5.00	      1.01	       9.90
2	5.20	      1.03	       10.10
3	4.90	      1.00	       9.80
4	5.10	      1.02	       10.00
5	5.00	      1.01	       9.90

Average time: 1.01 s
Average final velocity: 9.94 m/s

Graphical Analysis
Height vs Time: Parabolic curve — shows h∝t^2
Velocity vs Time: Straight line — confirms v∝t

Conclusion:
1. The simulation verifies the laws of motion under uniform acceleration.
2. Time of fall increases with height, and velocity increases linearly with time.
3. The average calculated final velocity (≈ 9.94 m/s) closely matches theoretical predictions for free fall under gravity.
